The Buildinator

Project Goal:
---
The Goal of this is project was to make an online application that allows users to
create/import starcraft 2 builds, then use those builds to practice from.

**Usage**
---

To use the Buildinator, simply select what way you want to input your build,(Manually or
via JSON import)

![screenshot][resources/demo/manualorjson.png]

When entering build items manually, simply type the object you want to build,
add the time and supply, and click add to build.

The best way to use the Buildinator, however, is by using the JSON import feature.
In order to make the usage of this application not tedious, I also created a script
that allows a user to make a build order from any replay. 

Please check out this script at the seperate github repo!
https://github.com/Soule222/sc2tools

The idea is that a user can either save these build files either on their own computer, or
via something like pastebin in order to easily plug in whatever they may want. 

Inluded in this repository are a couple of different builds for demo purposes. Just 
check out the demo folder and copy the text from any of the builds, paste it into 
the import field on the application, and the build order will be loaded into the table.
